- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to be a good swimmer who grasp 4 sytles including Butterfly, Backstroke, Breaststroke and Freestyle. However, because of staying up late for a long time, I can no longer swim very far in a row. Take me as a warning to protect your body! (And if you are in Harbin or HK in the future, I'm very willing to teach you my skills!
